# rock-paper-scissors-game
A simple JavaScript game of Rock, Paper, Scissors to showcase understanding of JavaScript concepts from The Odin Project.
Note:
Code is currently unfinished.
Project requirements state that the game should tally and announce the winner after 5 rounds of gameplay.
My challenge is in storing the variable for a winner after each round, and then using that variable outside the 'For Loop' after 5 rounds are over.
I'll need to research some more on how to achieve that final requirement.
